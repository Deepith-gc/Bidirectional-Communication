# Bidirectional-Communication
This project implements a complete, self-contained system featuring a client and a server that communicate using a custom lightweight protocol. The primary goals were to design a reliable communication protocol from scratch, implement it in Python, and deploy the entire system using Docker containers for isolated, reproducible environments.
The system supports bidirectional communication, including features like connection handshake, state transitions, and robust error handling as specified in the problem statement.
